# 5G-based Link-level Integrated Sensing and Communication Simulator
## This simulator is a preliminary effort for the [system-level platform](https://github.com/xds0112/5G_based_System_level_Integrated_Sensing_and_Communication_Simulator):
    Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) Link-level simulator (LLS)
    Used for testing key techniques and algorithms, and focuses on the communication physical (PHY) 
    layer modeling and radar signal processing procedures only.


## Members participated in this project:
    D. Xue, J. Wei, Y. Li, T. Zeng,
    Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education,
    Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,
    Beijing, P.R. China.


## MATLAB version and toolboxes required: 
    MATLAB R2021b or above,
    5G Toolbox, Phased Array System Toolbox.


## Main Features
    Link-level scenario generation (full downlink or TDD),
    Communication PHY layer modeling,
    Communication downlink and uplink signal processing,
    Sensing propagation channel modeling,
    Sensing detection and estimation


## Getting Started
    To simulate the full downlink ISAC scenario, run 'launchFullDownlinkSimulation' in the root directory,
    To simulate time division duplex (TDD) ISAC scenario,  run 'launchTimeDivisionDuplexSimulation' in the root directory,


## Documentation
    None at present.
